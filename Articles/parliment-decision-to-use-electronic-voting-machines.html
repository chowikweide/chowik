                <p>On the 17th of November, 2021, the parliament of Pakistan passed a bill that allow the amendment of the
                    style of voting. Therefore, from the next elections, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha/india/what-are-evms/articleshow/68807699.cms" target="_blank">Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)</a> will be used
                    in the next elections. The regular voting style is not considered satisfactory for pure voting. This
                    is a valid reason for the amendment of voting style, but it's not guaranteed that the new way of
                    voting will have fair results. There are a lot of objections by the opposition to the decision.
                    Therefore, the parliament’s decision to use electronic voting machines will lead to worse election
                    results than the manual voting system.</p>
                <p>Electronic voting machines require biometric verification. According to FIA, <a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/911801-fia-says-nadra-biometric-data-hacked" target="_blank">NADRA was hacked</a> last
                    week, which caused all of Pakistanis biometric data to be leaked to anonymous people. Since these
                    kinds of stuff may usually be available on the dark web for bitcoins, so anyone can buy and misuse
                    it for any purpose. Therefore, it’s clear that Pakistanis’ biometric data is unsafe and the EVMs can
                    be tampered with this data to produce the desired result, which may lead to unfair election results.

                <p>The minister of science, Shibli Faraz, opened a challenge for everyone to hack the EVM, and <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/369830-rs1-million-to-be-awarded-for-hacking-pakistan-made-evm-shibli-faraz" target="_blank">1 Million
                    PKR will be awarded to the person who will hack the EVM</a>. Nevertheless, According to BBC news: <strong>"A
                    hacker girl, Beatrice Atobatele, gained unauthorized access of EVM."</strong> It was hard for her to crack
                    the voting machines which are usually used in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p>However, she found ways to manipulate EVM data. Therefore, one can conclude that EVM is not that
                    secure, and can be used to produce unfair election results.</p>
                <p>According to a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep28473.5.pdf" target="_blank">scholarly research report</a>:<strong> "Manipulating voting machines is a concrete,
                    easy-to-understand method for tampering with elections. But is there an actual danger of such
                    attacks succeeding in the United States? Based on recent experiences in other countries, the
                    evolution of cyber-attacks over the last decade, and current vulnerabilities in our system, the
                    answer is yes."</strong> This report explicitly states that hacking voting machine is feasible if we seek
                    through recent cyber-attacks to malfunction EVMs.</p>
                <p>The same report also revealed the fact that tampering with electronic machines is not the only part
                    of manipulating the whole election result. Since data can also be hacked from the second node of the
                    server, not only the voting machine. In simpler words, the output of each vote count which is being
                    sent to the server can also tamper which makes it easier for a hacker to malfunction the electronic
                    voting system without having physical access to it.
                </p>
                <p>Furthermore, In the traditional voting system, voters know whom they are voting for. In case, if
                    someone forces one to give a vote, then at least one can report this to ECP. But, the EVMs will
                    transfer the data digitally. Manipulating digital data is not that hard for skilled people, and they
                    are also untraceable. In case of any suspected result of EVM, the hacker will remain anonymous.
                    Therefore, EVMs may not give transparent results when someone will tamper with the EVM.</p>
                <p>Other than the insecurity of EVM, there is one more crucial thing to argue the fact that EVMs are a
                    worse option as compared to the traditional voting style. Each <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2301258/evms-to-cost-rs25b-if-polls-held-in-single-day" target="_blank">voting machine costs</a> up to 5,00,000
                    PKR. According to a report published in 2018, there are 85,000 polling stations all over Pakistan.
                    Then, the total budget of only EVMs will be around 43 Billion PKR. If we seek through the current
                    economy of Pakistan, so it does not sound a good idea to use EVMs in the election if we compare it
                    to less expensive manual voting.</p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1645100" target="_blank">Election Commission of Pakistan raised 37 objections regarding the parliament's decision of using
                    EVMs</a>. According to the DAWN news, "The ECP also referred to various other issues linked with the use
                    of EVM, including lack of ballot secrecy, lack of capacity at all levels and lack of ensuring
                    security and chain of custody for the machines at rest and during transportation. It also pointed
                    out that there would be no evidence available in
                    case of an election dispute. The ECP noted that data integration and configuration issues may crop
                    up due to court orders at the eleventh hour regarding a change in the ballot paper." In the above
                    statement, the writer, Iftikhar Ahsan Khan, mainly talked about the concerns regarding electronic
                    voting machines. Its vulnerability is not uncommon and can not be ignored as it will be the future
                    of the next four years of Pakistan. Therefore, using EVMs without ensuring that it won't lead to
                    unfair results is not a good option at all.
                </p>
                <p>According to cyber security experts, ethical hackers, and bug hunters, the <a href="https://www.geo.tv/latest/369415-evms-are-hackable-and-tamper-prone-warns-ecp" target="_blank">EVMs are hackable</a>. Undoubtedly, they are hard to hack, but there is some probability that someone can misuse them. When there is a probability of misuse of EVMs, then saying that EVM will always provide fair results is not justified. Moreover, according to past stories, EVMs were being hacked for manipulating election results. In addition to it, the economy of Pakistan is also not that good to afford each electronic voting machine for such a big number of polling stations. Therefore, it is true to conclude that EVMs may lead to worst election results than ever!</p>
